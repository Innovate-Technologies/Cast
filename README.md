Cast 1.0 (Beta 1)
================

Cast is a modern streaming solution built to accomodate the demands of modern radio streaming. The 90s have long since passed, it's time that we pass with it.
Cast is released under the AGPLv3 license and has been built with love and care by Maarten Eyskens and LÃ©o Lam of Innovate Technologies.

Pillars
-------

0. Hackability
Cast is built to be _hacked_ to suit your needs. It's your streaming server, why shouldn't it be tailored exactly how you want it to be? Cast is built especially with this in mind. We made hooks that makes data sharing to your site, app or spaceship super easy! Fork away.
1. Compatibility
Cast is built to work with all of the widely used streaming standards in an innovative way. If you use Icecast or SHOUTcast, you'll be able to use Cast in exactly the same way. No complications, welcome to the 21st century.
2. Innovation
The clue's behind the name, **Innovate** Technologies. Cast is built on the definition of innovation. The 90s was dull, boring and most importantly; 15 years ago. Cast promises an innovative solution to streaming. Combining clever, modern code with a beautiful UI; you really cannot go wrong.

Installation
-------

Installing Cast is quite simple. All you need is a computer with Node.JS installed. 
First of all get a copy of this repo (via a zip file or git). Then run `npm install` and `node server.js`. That should do it.

Motivation
-------

Before Cast, there was Icecast and SHOUTcast. Sure, they _work_. The problem with both of them is that they're based on code written by exhausted developers in _you guessed it_, the nineties. This doesn't make either of them bad, it just means it may not be for everyone. This makes using Icecast and SHOUTcast a little more difficult than we think it has to be, so we've built Cast from the ground up using Node.JS to reduce the tears and increase the laughs. 
We have years of experience with both of those and combined the best features of the two but also some of our own ideas.
Not only this, but there's an annoying snag with SHOUTcast and Icecast. It's also quite difficult to build off of, we're changing that with Cast. If you want to stem off your own project based on Cast, you can!
The other thing with Icecast and SHOUTcast is the outdated UI. Say goodbye to Web 1.0 with Cast. We introduce a ***gorgeous*** streaming page with an equally gorgeous UI.

Limitations
-------

>Nobody's perfect.

(does anyone remember who's famous for singing that?) Anyway, like everything... Cast does have a few downfalls for its humble version 1.0. Listed below are these limitations and alternatives and/or what we're planning to do to eliminate those in upcoming versions.

* Big audience? Cast isn't built to cater for large amounts of listeners. For this, it's best to stick with Icecast (we're plannning to accomadate you guys soon!).
* B-_OGG_ OFF! Cast 1.0 doesn't support OGG streaming, we're super sorry about that and of course we are planning to implement this at a later date. Until then, you're best off with Icecast which supports everything OGG.
* Ad insertion! You must be M _ad_ (get it?) to think we support that yet. Sadly, Cast 1.0 doesn't support the insertion of ads yet. SHOUTcast (or Icecast KH) will do the job nicely.
* Cast 1.0 is a little tough on old hardware at the minute. Because Cast is still being streamlined to perfection, it's a little heavy on memory. Whilst load levels won't be severe, you might have better loads using Icecast or SHOUTcast.
* Cast 1.0 currently has no statistics yet. We're working on building these in before the final version.
Advice
-------

There's a saying in England, mainly used by distressed mothers to try and get their children to eat their dinner without complaining.
>If you don't like it, _lump_ it!

Cast is still very much in its baby stages. We're learning how to walk and we'd like you to walk with us. Whilst we're by no means perfect, we're getting there... slowly and with a lot of willpower (and iced tea).
If you don't particularly feel Cast is for you, there's always [SHOUTcast](http://shoutcast.com) and [Icecast](http://icecast.org). Solid and trusted by many.

This is a *beta* version of Cast 1.0, we have a lot of new awesome features on the roadmap. Just give us some time.
